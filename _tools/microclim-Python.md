title: microclimPythonApi - Phython API toolkit for microclim.org
excerpt: Phython API toolkit for accessing microclimate data
---
In addition to a web interface, we have developed a Python API to access the microclimate data employing REST APIs. This API toolkit implements all the APIs provided by microclim.org service. It is designed to be a convenience package shielding the user from the API internals. API usage is demonstrated [here](https://github.com/trenchproject/microclimRapi/blob/master/vignettes/microclim.ipynb).
