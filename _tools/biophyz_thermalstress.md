Interactive website(http://biophys.microclim.org) to visualize thermal stress. We are developing a mapping interface to integrate the output of the biophysical models with data on species distributions and regions where animal species are likely to experience thermal stress. The interface will enable users to explore example species or choose the size, shape, and coloration of a generic ectotherm to model.
