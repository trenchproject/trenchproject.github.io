Microclimate data - http://microclim.org. We are currently distributing microclimate (hourly, 36km resolution) data covering the United States for past (1980-1999) and future (2080-2099) time periods. The data were created by dynamic downscaling using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. We are working towards providing near real time microclimate data based on satellite observations. We are also working to expand the geographic scope and time period of the available data.
