TrenchR - R package encompassing functions for assessing the impact of the environment of organisms. We aim to develop transparent and accessible energy budget models to translate microclimate into estimates of animal body temperature. We estimate body temperatures by balancing energy inputs and outputs associated with solar and thermal radiation, conduction (via contact with surfaces), and convection (via air flow). Our models will be accessible via both an online interface and an R package. We are developing our tools in collaboration with the NicheMapR initiative.
